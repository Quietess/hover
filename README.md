# hover
hover is a fork of kasuja created by quietess, kasuja was created by rideag

  how to:
  
1. install stylish - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/

2. open add-ons menu

3. go to user styles

4. click on write new style

5. copy code from hover.css into the fields provided


i recommend going into the firefox customize thing and taking the "+" button that opens new tabs out by dragging it off

in terms of closing and opening new tabs either use right clicking or middle mouse button

btw install waterfox, it's way more lightweight than actual firefox and feels a lot faster
